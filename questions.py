# Question 3:
# Please write a python function, max_num_in_list to return the max number of a given list. The first line of the code has been defined as below.

def max_num_in_list(a_list):
	max = a_list [ 0 ]
	for a in a_list:
		if a > max:
			max = a
	return max
print(max_num_in_list([4, 2, -3, 1]))
